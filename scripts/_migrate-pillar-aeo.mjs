      'Before AI can extend a workflow, the workflow has to work. Workflow Optimization is the discipline of making how work actually gets done observable, repeatable, and controllable &mdash; defining decision points, clarifying handoffs, categorizing exceptions, and removing friction before automation is layered on top.',
      'Most mid-market workflows are not designed; they evolved. Over years of system additions, vendor switches, staff turnover, and manual workarounds, what looks like a process is often a set of loosely connected actions held together by experience. Humans navigate the gaps without much trouble. AI cannot.',
      'FAA optimizes workflows before applying AI because automation amplifies whatever it inherits. A clean workflow makes AI a force multiplier on margin, throughput, and cycle time. A broken workflow turns AI into a risk multiplier &mdash; running faster but failing in the same places, more often, with less explanation.',

Automation built on tribal knowledge, manual overrides, and unclear approval paths runs faster but also fails faster. A clean workflow makes AI a force multiplier; a broken workflow turns it into a risk multiplier.' },

Automation owners are accountable for outcomes, not just throughput.' },

Outputs land somewhere no one owns. Controls are improvised after the fact. The model performs; the operating system around it does not.',
